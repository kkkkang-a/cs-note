# Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm should do.

It is written in a formal yet readable style that uses a natural syntax and formatting so it can be easily understood by programmers and others involved in the development process

## Syntax

Pseudocode does not have a particular fixed syntax. It is more like a code-like way of explaining what we do. The so-called style of your pseudocode can be C-like, Python-like or Java-like.

Control flow:
- `if ... then ... else ...`
- `while ... do ...`
- `repeat ... until ...`
- `for ... do ...`
- Indentation replaces braces

Method call:
- `method (arg, arg...)`

Return value:
- `return {expression}`
